abstract = {Energy / economic models must predict the mix of energy technologies in competitive energy markets. We examine a market composed of several competing technologies with geographically heterogeneous cost distributions. An approach for determining both the market share and average market cost of energy produced by these technologies is derived. The formalism developed, which is based on a conditional least cost distribution function, can be used to correct the convertional logit treatment of these quantities in several existing models and to better interpret empirical data in order to determine more realistic cost distribution functions for energy technologies. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

@article{Hirth2015,
abstract = {The integration of wind and solar generators into power systems causes "integration costs" - for grids, balancing services, more flexible operation of thermal plants, and reduced utilization of the capital stock embodied in infrastructure, among other things. This paper proposes a framework to analyze and quantify these costs. We propose a definition of integration costs based on the marginal economic value of electricity, or market value - as such a definition can be more easily used in economic cost-benefit assessment than previous approaches. We suggest decomposing integration costs intro three components, according to the principal characteristics of wind and solar power: temporal variability, uncertainty, and location-constraints. Quantitative estimates of these components are extracted from a review of 100 + published studies. At high penetration rates, say a wind market share of 30-40{\%}, integration costs are found to be 25-35 €/MWh, i.e. up to 50{\%} of generation costs. While these estimates are system-specific and subject to significant uncertainty, integration costs are certainly too large to be ignored in high-penetration assessments (but might be ignored at low penetration). The largest single factor is reduced utilization of capital embodied in thermal plants, a cost component that has not been accounted for in most previous integration studies.},

@article{Hoogwijk2009,
abstract = {We explored the production cost of energy crops at abandoned agricultural land and at rest land at a regional and a global level to the year 2050 using four different land-use scenarios. The estimations were based on grid cell data on the productivity of short-rotation crops on the available land over time and assumptions regarding the capital and the labour input required to reach these productivity levels. It was concluded that large amounts of grown biomass at abandoned agricultural land and rest land, 130-270 EJ yr-1 (about 40-70{\%} of the present energy consumption) may be produced at costs below {\$}2 GJ-1 by 2050 (present lower limit of cost of coal). Interesting regions because of their low production cost and significant potentials are the Former USSR, Oceania, Eastern and Western Africa and East Asia. Such low costs presume significant land productivity improvements over time and cost reductions due to learning and capital-labour substitution. An assessment of biomass fuel cost, using the primary biomass energy costs, showed that the future costs of biomass liquid fuels may be in the same order of the present diesel production costs, although this may change in the long term. Biomass-derived electricity costs are at present slightly higher than electricity baseload costs and may directly compete with estimated future production costs of fossil fuel electricity with CO2 sequestration. The present world electricity consumption of around 20 PWh yr-1 may be generated in 2050 at costs below {\$}45 MWh-1 in A1 and B1 and below {\$}55 MWh-1 in A2 and B2. At costs of {\$}60 MWh-1, about 18 (A2) to 53 (A1) PWh yr-1 can be produced. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
