IMACLIM-R is a twelve region,recursive hybrid general equilibrium model that includes a technology-rich,bottom-up electricity module. The long-term investment decision is represented by a modified multinomial logit structure in which 20 explicit technologies compete based on the most current electricity generation costs. The cost competition takes place under imperfect foresight and with various possible regimes of beliefs about future climate policy. Key characteristics of electricity supply are presented: Capital obsolescence, fuel efficiency, load factor, carbon capture and storage, renewable integration challenges. Both investment and dispatch decisions are made on an annual basis, beginning in 2015, to provide meaningful insights into future electricity systems, their contribution to climate change mitigation, and their linkages with the rest of the economy.
