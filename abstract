IMACLIM-R is a twelve region, recursive, hybrid general equilibrium model that includes a technology-rich, bottom-up electricity module. The long term investment decision is represented by a modified multinomial logit structure in which 20 explicit technologies compete based on the most up-to-date electricity generation costs. The cost competition takes place under imperfect foresight and with different possible regimes of beliefs about future climate policy. The key features of the electricity supply are represented: capital vintaging, fuel efficiency, utilization rate, carbon capture and storage, renewable energy integration challenges. Both investment and dispatch decisions are made on an annual basis, starting in 2015, to provide meaningful insights into future electricity systems, their contribution to climate change mitigation and their linkages with the rest of the economy.
