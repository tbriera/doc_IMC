For renewables, Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2019 (IRENA, 2020), when data for 2014 is available. When it is not, the 2019 data is used to go backwards on the learning curve, assuming the relationship between the installed capacity and the investment costs hold for the years 2014-2019 . For other technologies (except oil and biomass), Power generation assumptions in the Stated Policies and SDS Scenarios in the World Energy Outlook 2021 - Assumptions for additional technologies and regions in the Stated Policies and Net Zero scenarios (IEA, 2021). For biomass, Cost development of low carbon energy technologies (JRC, 2018). For oil, Lazard's Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis version 8.0 (Lazard, 2014).
